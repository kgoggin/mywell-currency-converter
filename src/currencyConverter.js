/**
 * Our API handles currency as a floating point number, dollars and cents.
 * The API we use for processing transactions requires that currency be
 * represented as a whole number of cents. So, we need a way to convert
 * a currency from our system to the format required for processing.
 *
 * Implement this function so that it performs the needed conversion. Write
 * some tests that can be used to verify it's working correctly.
